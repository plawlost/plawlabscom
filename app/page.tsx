We begin with code, but we're building for something far bigger, something no one has dared to make truly possible.

              Before this new chapter, in 2024 we set out to build agentic hardware straight out of high school, with zero capital, zero permission, and nothing but drive. We launched in the Emirates, watched our first team shatter, and gathered every hard lesson at full speed. What we rebuilt out of those ashes is sharper, tighter, and aimed straight at the heart of real problems. Scar tissue became focus.

                We believe the future won't belong to whoever gets there first with the biggest brain, the most servers, or the loudest headlines. We're not here to chase "superintelligence" for the sake of it. We're here to make intelligence that's unconditionally yours, always.
              </p>

              <p>
                Most AI today is a rented mind. Log in, take what you're given, and leave your ideas behind someone else's glass. Plaw stands for the opposite: <em>we exist to give anyone, from the obsessed indie builder to tomorrow's most ambitious teams, a foundation of sovereign intelligence they can hold, shape, and deploy without compromise, permission, or backdoors.</em>
              </p>

              <p>
                We build Plaw with the certainty that AI is moving at blinding speed, with a clear view of how fragile its foundations are.
              </p>

              <p>
                We've seen friends ship world-changing apps overnight, powered by AI, only to discover code full of invisible holes that nobody could trust. That's why we built <a href="https://vulnzap.com" className="underline decoration-2 underline-offset-4 hover:bg-[#f0f0f0] px-1 transition-colors">Vulnzap</a>, the first true immune system for an AI-native world: real-time, in-editor defense for code written at machine speed. It protects what you build from the inside out, not a security guard after the fact but a partner at every single keystroke.
              </p>

              <p>
                But this is only chapter one. Just like Steve Jobs saw the computer as a bicycle for the mind, we see sovereign intelligence as the most powerful tool anyone can own in this century, if it's truly under their control.

                We're not a lab. We don't sell research papers, slide decks, or AI vapor. We ship real tools for people whose work doesn't wait.

                We are two cofounders, <em>Yaz (vision, generalist, CEO) and Anirudh (technical lead, cofounder, CTO)</em>, building alongside <em>Sherif (founding engineer)</em> and <em>Kyrie (head of marketing & sales)</em>. Our team is fully remote, with roots in Turkey, India, Egypt, and Canada. Originally PlawLabs, we're currently in the process of incorporating as Plaw Inc. in Delaware - right where new legends are made.
              </p>

              <p>
                We want engineers and designers who want to work at the metal, where responsibility meets ambition, and who feel both the thrill and the dread of putting new powers in human hands. <em>Bring us your edge and your skepticism - we'll use both.</em>
              </p>

              <p>
                If you believe intelligence should never be rented and that <em>"secure by default"</em> is non-negotiable, this is your invitation. <em>Help us build what everyone will depend on, but no one will control for you.</em>
